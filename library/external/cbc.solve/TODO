* cbc.solve
** Align the interfaces of the solvers
*** Make the function names as close as possible
*** Make the file layout identical
*** Take useful functions from one to the other
**** twist -> flow: Automatic conversion of floats to DOLFIN constants
**** twist -> flow: Easy specification of boundary conditions and boundary
*** Share mode code via common
* cbc.twist
** Figure out why the Gent-Thomas material model does not converge
** Figure out how to specify material models in terms of principal stretches.
*** This might require UFL hacking to handle trigonometric functions (and derivatives) of functions.
** Figure out how to specify material models in terms of modified strains
*** This requires specification of higher order tensors and their products (contraction, for instance)
** Show how to set Dirichlet boundary conditions for some (not all) of the displacement components
* cbc.swing
** Move FSI example into its own class
